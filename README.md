# HelloInputSystemAndroidToBoolean
In this repository, I try to learn how to use the new input system on Android to convert joystick and controller to boolean.


Note. Kind of find how but it is an other story.
You can listen to Unity interfaceo or you can directly listen to HID of Unity and do your own.
